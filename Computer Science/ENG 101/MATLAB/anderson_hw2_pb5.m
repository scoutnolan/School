x = []; % creates an emtpy array
a = 2; % lower boundary of the vector
b = input('Input the upper boundary '); %upper boundary of the vector
z = a:b; % Creates a logical vector from 2 to the inputted variable
p = isprime(z); % function that finds the prime numbers indicated by the range of n
y = z(p) % creates an array based on the values found in p


% sorry, can't program for any longer today. brain = mush. Function is awful.
